                The term sexual assault refers to sexual contact or behavior that occurs without explicit consent of the victim. Some forms of sexual assault include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Attempted rape</li>
                    <li>Fondling or unwanted sexual touching</li>
                    <li>Forcing a victim to perform sexual acts, such as oral sex or penetrating the perpetrator’s body</li>
                    <li>Penetration of the victim’s body, also known as rape</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                Rape is a form of sexual assault, but not all sexual assault is rape. The term rape is often used as a legal 
                definition to specifically include sexual penetration without consent. For its Uniform Crime Reports, the FBI 
                defines rape as “penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral 
                penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.”

                The majority of perpetrators are someone known to the victim. Approximately <b>eight out of 10 sexual assaults</b> are committed by 
                someone known to the victim, such as in the case of <b><a href="#partner-violence" style="color: white;">intimate partner sexual violence</a></b> or acquaintance rape. <br>

                The term <b>“date rape”</b> is sometimes used to refer to acquaintance rape. Perpetrators of acquaintance rape might be a date, but 
                they could also be a classmate, a neighbor, a friend’s significant other, or any number of different roles. It’s important to 
                remember that dating, instances of past intimacy, or other acts like kissing do not give someone consent for increased or continued 
                sexual contact. <br>

                In other instances the victim may not know the perpetrator at all. This type of sexual violence is sometimes referred to as stranger 
                rape. Stranger rape can occur in several different ways: <br>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Blitz sexual assault:</b> when a perpetrator quickly and brutally assaults the victim with no prior contact, usually at night in a public place</li>
                    <li><b>Contact sexual assault:</b> when a perpetrator contacts the victim and tries to gain their trust by flirting, luring the victim to their car, or otherwise trying to coerce the victim into a situation where the sexual assault will occur</li>
                    <li><b>Home invasion sexual assault:</b> when a stranger breaks into the victim’s home to commit the assault</li>
                </ul>
              
            Survivors of both stranger rape and acquaintance rape often blame themselves for behaving in a way that encouraged the perpetrator. 
            It’s important to remember that the victim is never to blame for the actions of a perpetrator.

                Sexual violence most often is perpetrated by someone a survivor knows, and this includes intimate partner relationships. 
                There are many different terms to refer to sexual violence that occurs within intimate partnerships, including: intimate partner sexual violence, 
                domestic violence, intimate partner rape, marital rape, and spousal rape. No matter what term is used or how the relationship is defined, 
                it is never okay to engage in sexual activity without someone’s consent. <br>

                <b style="font-size: 22px">Who does intimate partner sexual violence affect?</b> <br>

                Intimate partner sexual violence can occur in all types of intimate relationships regardless of gender identities or sexual orientation. 
                Intimate partner sexual violence is not defined by gender or sexuality, but by abusive behavior. Learn more about how sexual violence can 
                affect LGBTQ survivors and additional challenges they may face. <br>

                <b style="font-size: 22px">How does intimate partner sexual violence relate to other kinds of abuse?</b> <br>

                Sexual violence in a relationship is rarely an isolated incident. It often occurs alongside other forms of abusive behavior, including physical 
                and emotional abuse. For instance, the majority of women who are physically assaulted by an intimate partner have been sexually assaulted by that 
                same partner. <br>

                Intimate partner sexual violence often starts with controlling behavior that can escalate to further emotional, physical, and sexual abuse. <br>        

                <b style="font-size: 22px">Warning Signs of abuse include a partner who:</b> <br>

                <ul>
                    <li>Attempts to cut you off from friends and family</li>
                    <li>Is extremely jealous or upset if you spend time away from them</li>
                    <li>Insults you, puts you down, says that you can never do anything right</li>
                    <li>Tries to prevent you from attending work or school</li>
                    <li>Tries to prevent you from making decisions for yourself</li>
                    <li>Destroys your property, attempts to harm your pets</li>
                    <li>Threatens to harm your children or take them away from you</li>
                    <li>Tells you that you are worthless and that no one else could ever love you</li>
                    <li>Controls your finances</li>
                </ul>

                <b style="font-size: 22px">Why should I reach out?</b> <br>

                If you have experienced sexual assault by an intimate partner, it can be challenging to come forward for many reasons. You may be concerned 
                for your safety or the safety of your children, worried about your financial situation or about what your family might think, still have strong
                 feelings for your partner, or not feel like you can call what happened to you sexual assault. It’s understandable to feel this way.
