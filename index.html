                <b>Sexual assault</b> can happen to anyone at anytime by anyone. Yet, it is not talked about enough - 
                majority of assaults are left unreported, a majority of reported cases are followed through, and many victims struggle with 
                victim blaming and shame. <br>
                This website is to <b>raise awareness</b> about these incidents and educate the community about what sexual assault is and
                the different contexts of their occurrences, including but not limited to relationship abuse. Through stories of real victims and 
                their journey of recovery and healing, we hope to create a <b>sense of community</b> for other survivors who may feel alone and lost with their
                trauma. In addition, we are to provide survivors, their loved ones, and activists with resources. <br>
                The collective goal as a movement is to <b>educate the public</b> and <b>remove the stigma</b> of talking about the trauma of countless victims,
                to reduce victim blaming, and focus the root of the problem: perpetrators. Change from within starts with everyone, to 
                take action as a member of a community to support survivors and educate themselves about consent and support those with these 
                experiences.
